# Problem
- A manufacturer of pain relief medication claims that its new formula provides
faster pain relief than the existing formula. Design a hypothesis 
test to understand if the claim is true.
- The trial involves 50 participants randomly assigned to two groups: 
one receiving the new formula and the other receiving the existing formula. 
The manufacturer wants to determine if there is a statistically 
significant difference in the mean time to pain relief between the two groups.
- New Formula: 
  - Mean time to pain relief is found to be 15 minutes.
  - 4 minutes of standard deviation.
- Existing Formula:
  - Mean time to pain relief is found to be 20 minutes.
  - 5 minutes of standard deviation.

# Step 1: Formulate the hypotheses
- The null hypothesis is that the mean time to pain relief
for the new formula is the same as the mean time
to pain relief for the existing formula.

# Step 2: Select the statistical test
