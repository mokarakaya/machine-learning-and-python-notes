# Standard Error
- Standard error is used to calculate:
  - likely difference between the sample mean and the population mean.
  - We know the sample mean and standard deviation.
  - We don't know the population.
- We want to know if we have enough samples.
- `SE = std / sqrt(N)` where:
  - std: standard deviation of the sample.
  - N: sample size.
- Margin of Error: 
  - `ME = z * SE`
  - `z = 1.96` -> 95% confidence.
  - `z = 2.576` -> 99% confidence.
  - ME: We are x% confident that population mean is +- ME away from the sample mean.
