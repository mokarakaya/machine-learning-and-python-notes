# Define the problem
-  Suggested posts from content creators.
- May or may not be followers
- ML I/O
    - Data
      - Input:
        - viewer
          - interaction history
        - post
          - post creator's features.
          - embeddings for video, audio, text.
            - embeddings created by other models.
      - Output:
        - interaction like, comment.
- ML Objective:
  - Training objectives.
    - engage with the content. like/comment etc. 
  - Business level objectives.
    - Improve daily active users.
    - Improve session engagement.
  - Non-functional 
    - scalable
    - available
    - monitoring
    - debugability
    - alerts and warning.
- ML Category:
  - ranking.
# Design the data processing pipeline
# Create a model architecture
- Pipeline
  - Candidate generation
    - ANN
    - Compute embeddings for:
      - viewers
      - posts
    - How to create embeddings:
      - Collaborative filtering
        - Decomposition
        - Not the current standart.
      - Two tower network techinique
        - a neural network with classification with layers:
          - viewer features, post features
          - Viewer tower, Post item tower
            - We don't have densely connected layers between towers.
            - But they are trained together.
          - d dimentional viewer embeddings, d dimentional post embeddings.
          - sigmoid layer
          - label.
        - binary cross entropy loss.
        - stochastic gradient descent
        - adam optimizer.
        - AUC ROC curve. 80% target.
  - Ranking
    - We may use the same model (two tower)
  - Post-processing
# Train the model
# Evaluate the model
- AUC ROC
  - 80%
- A/B test
  - N number of users are shown existing model.
  - N number of users are shown new model.
  - Do we have more daily active users
  - Do we have more user engagement.
- Safeguard metrics:
  - Does it increase reports.
# Deploy and monitor the model
# Wrap up 
- Deployment and monitoring.
- Online learning.
- How to scale training and serving.
- Imbalanced data.
