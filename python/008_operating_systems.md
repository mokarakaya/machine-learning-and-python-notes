# Operating Systems
- Mutexes (Mutual Exclusion):
  - Only one thread can access to the critical section.
  - `threading.Lock()`
- Semaphores:
  - Binary Semaphore: Acts like mutex.
  - Counting Semaphore: 
    - Allows n number of threads to access to the resource simultaneously.
  - `threading.Semaphore(n)`
- Deadlock:
  - Thread A locks Resource1 and waits for Resource2
  - Thread B locks Resource2 and waits for Resource1
  - To prevent:
    - Acquire locks in specific order.
    - Use timeouts for lock acquisition.
    - Identify and solve deadlocks dynamically.
- Threading:
  - CPython with GIL will allow only one thread to execute Python bytecode.
  - But it's still useful for I/O bound tasks
    - as thread will be released during I/O.
  - Cython can bypass GIL and useful for CPU bound tasks.
