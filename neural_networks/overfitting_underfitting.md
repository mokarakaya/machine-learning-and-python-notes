# Overcoming Overfitting:
- Increase training data.
- Apply L1/L2 Regularization
- Dropout
- Early stopping
- Reduce model complexity
- Cross validation

# Overcoming Underfitting
- Increase model complexity
- Train for longer
- Reduce regularization
- Add more features
- Increase quality and quantity of the data.
