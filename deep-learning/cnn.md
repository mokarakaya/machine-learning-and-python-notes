# Convolutional Neural Networks
- Neural networks do not scale to process images since they are fully connected. For example, for a full-color 200 x 200 pixel image, our input layer would have 200 x 200 x 3 = 120,000 weights. This is a lot for a fully connected layer. CNN removes the cumbersome, and focuses on edges, lines etc. so it can extract information very efficiently.
